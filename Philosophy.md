So the philosophy behind the game is as follows(for now):
You are stranded on an unknown planet, you have no resources and must survive, 
thrive and eventually build a colony and gtfo or live out your days on the planet.

It will be a top-down survival RPG with base-building elements.

We'll also be using procedurally generated worlds for our planets.
